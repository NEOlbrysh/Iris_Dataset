# Iris_Dataset

## Introduction
The central goal is to design a model that makes proper classifications for new flowers.
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification, machine learning, and data visualization.
The dataset contains: 3 classes with 50 samples each, and then four numeric properties about those classes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
One species, Iris Setosa, is "linearly separable" from the other two. This means that we can draw a line between Iris Setosa samples and samples corresponding to the other two species.


## Predicted Attribute:
Class of Iris plant.


## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to gain introductory exposure to Machine Learning Classification concepts along with data visualization. The project utilizes Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Data Visualization Libraries.
